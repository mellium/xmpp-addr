An implementation of [RFC 7622], the XMPP Address Format, more commonly known as
"Jabber IDs" or "JIDs".

Currently, due to Rust not having a [PRECIS] implementation, this package is not
fully compliant with 7622.

[RFC 7622]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7622
[PRECIS]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7564
